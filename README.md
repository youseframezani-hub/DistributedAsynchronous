# DistributedAsynchronous
# Ability to synchronize a process distributed across multiple systems
# The DistributedAsynchronous library allows you to wait for the result of a processing on another machine
# This library is currently using the "Pub/Sub" feature of the Redis database
# You can also use other available tools that provide "Pub / Sub" capability, which you can participate in the development of this library if you wish :)
